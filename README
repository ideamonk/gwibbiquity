			a theme for Gwibber client


INSTALLATION
-------------
To install the new gwibber theme:

   1. Download the new theme
   2. Decompress it to ~/.local/share/gwibber/ui/themes/. 
      You should end up with a folder called gwibbiquity with a few files inside it.
      Make that path if it not present
   3. In Gwibber, open Preferences (Gwibber->Preferences or Ctrl+P). 
      Pull down the theme chooser and choose ‘gwibbiquity’.
   4. On my system, it took Gwibber a few seconds to apply the new theme. 
      Be patient, and things should shape up.
      
      * thanks to Jake Tolbert for easy installation instructions
